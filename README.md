# First: A simple Drupal 7 Module

The First module provides a block that lists all of the modules currently 
enabled on a site.

This module illustrates the following Drupal tools:

  * Info files
  * Basic module files
  * hook_help
  * hook_block_info
  * hook_block_view
  * SimpleTest
  * Invoking a hook
  * Using t()

## Installation

The First module is installed just like any other Drupal module.

  1. Clone this repository or grab a tagged download
  2. Put the module in your Drupal installation's `sites/all/modules` directory
  3. Go to the `Modules` screen in Drupal administration and enable the module.

## Etc.

Please report any issues you find with this code.

Special thanks to my co-authors (especially sdboyer, who found the first
reported bug) and my technical reviewers.
